    Welcome to my homepage! &nbsp;</p>    

    I am currently a fourth year PhD student in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cse.umn.edu/isye">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</a>, 
    under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://zhaosong-lu.github.io/index.html">Professor Zhaosong Lu</a>. Previously, I received my bacholer's degree from the <a target="_blank" href="https://math.xmu.edu.cn/en/">School of Mathematical Sciences</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.xmu.edu.cn/">Xiamen University</a>, 
    with thesis advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.math.fsu.edu/~whuang2/">Professor Wen Huang</a>. I am particularly interested in algorithm design and analysis with applications in fields including statistics, engineering and machine learning. 
    My current research focuses on the development of new complexity theory in continuous optimization, motivated by modern machine learning problems.
